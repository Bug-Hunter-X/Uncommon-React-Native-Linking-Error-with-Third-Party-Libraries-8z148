# Uncommon React Native Linking Error with Third-Party Libraries

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug in React Native development involving issues with linking third-party libraries.  The error manifests in cryptic error messages that don't directly point to the linking problem, leading to significant debugging challenges.  The solution focuses on ensuring proper linking and configuration of the external library.

## Bug Description
When integrating a third-party library into a React Native project, unexpected behavior or crashes can occur if the library isn't correctly linked. The standard error messages often lack the specificity to diagnose the exact problem, making debugging time-consuming.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the steps in `ThirdPartyLibraryBug.js` to observe the error.

## Solution
The solution in `ThirdPartyLibrarySolution.js` demonstrates proper linking techniques to resolve the issue. It highlights the importance of verifying the library's documentation and using appropriate methods for linking based on the chosen library manager (e.g., CocoaPods, Gradle, npm).
