To fix this, ensure you've correctly linked the library using the instructions provided in its documentation.  This usually involves steps like:

1. **Installing the library:**  `npm install some-third-party-library` or `yarn add some-third-party-library`
2. **Linking (if required):**  Some libraries need manual linking using platform-specific commands. Consult the library's documentation for details.
3. **Verifying configuration:** Check your `android/app/build.gradle` and `ios/{YourProjectName}.xcodeproj` to ensure the library is correctly integrated into the native project files.
4. **Cleaning and rebuilding:** After linking, it's often essential to clean your project's build cache. Use commands like `react-native run-android --clean` or `react-native run-ios --clean`.

```javascript
import { SomeComponent } from 'some-third-party-library'; // Ensure the library is correctly linked

// ... later in your component ...
<SomeComponent/>
```
