This error occurs when using a third-party library in React Native that's not properly linked or configured.

```javascript
import { SomeComponent } from 'some-third-party-library';

// ... later in your component ...
<SomeComponent/>
```

The error message might not directly point to the linking issue, leading to difficulty in debugging.
